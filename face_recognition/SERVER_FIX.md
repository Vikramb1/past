# Server "Not Ready" Issue - FIXED! ✅

## Problem
When you snapped, you got: "payment failed: server not ready"

## Root Causes Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Dependency ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** The `form-data` npm package was missing
**Solution:** Installed with `npm install form-data`

### 2. Wrong Port Number ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** 
- Server was running on port **3000**
- Python code was looking for port **3001**

**Solution:** Changed `suicrypto.ts` to use port 3001:
```typescript
const PORT = 3001;  // Changed from 3000
```

## Test Results ✅

Server now:
- ✅ Starts successfully
- ✅ Runs on port 3001
- ✅ Responds to health checks
- ✅ Shows all SUI and XRPL endpoints

## Try It Now!

```bash
cd /Users/vikra/past/face_recognition
python main.py
```

Then:
1. Say: **"send 0.0001 SUI"** or **"send 0.0001 XRPL"**
2. Hold snap gesture for 2+ seconds
3. Should work now! 🎉

## What You'll See

The server will automatically start when you run `python main.py` and you'll see:

```
🚀 Starting crypto server...
✅ Crypto server ready at http://localhost:3001

Multi-Chain Crypto API Server Started ✨
Port: 3001

🔷 SUI Testnet Endpoints:
  POST http://localhost:3001/gift-crypto
  
🔶 XRPL EVM Sidechain Endpoints:
  POST http://localhost:3001/xrpl/gift-crypto
```

Then when you snap:
```
💰 Payment triggered by 2.1s snap hold!
💸 Sending 0.0001 SUI
✅ SUI crypto gift successful!
```

All fixed! 🚀
