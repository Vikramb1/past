## Testing Checklist

Before running, verify:

- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [ ] Camera accessible
- [ ] (Optional) Known faces added to `known_faces/`

To test:

```bash
# Test 1: Basic detection (no known faces)
python main.py

# Test 2: With known faces
mkdir -p known_faces/test_person
# Add photos to known_faces/test_person/
python main.py

# Test 3: External camera
python main.py --type external --source 1

# Test 4: Add person via script
python add_person.py "John Doe" path/to/photo.jpg

# Test 5: Check logs
ls -la logs/
cat logs/events_*.csv
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance on typical hardware:

**Laptop (Intel i5, no GPU):**
- Detection + Recognition: 15-30 FPS
- Detection only: 30-60 FPS

**Desktop (GPU-enabled):**
- Detection + Recognition: 30-60 FPS
- Detection only: 60-120 FPS

**Raspberry Pi 4:**
- Detection + Recognition: 5-15 FPS
- Detection only: 10-25 FPS

Optimize by adjusting:
- `PROCESS_EVERY_N_FRAMES` (higher = faster)
- `DETECTION_SCALE` (lower = faster)
- `DETECTION_MODEL` ("hog" = faster, "cnn" = accurate)
