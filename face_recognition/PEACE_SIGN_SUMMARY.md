# Peace Sign iMessage Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Peace Sign Detection
- Added `_detect_peace_sign()` method to `gesture_detector.py`
- Detects when index and middle fingers are extended with others folded
- Uses MediaPipe hand landmarks for accurate detection
- Visual feedback shows "PEACE!" when detected

### 2. iMessage Handler Updates
- Simplified `imessage_handler.py` to remove voice triggers
- Added `send_transcript()` method to send captured text
- Configured to capture last 15 seconds of transcript
- Maintains 5-second cooldown between messages

### 3. Main Application Integration
- Modified `main.py` to detect peace sign gestures
- When peace sign detected, captures last 15 seconds of transcript
- Sends transcript to +15109773150 via iMessage
- Includes cooldown checking to prevent spam

### 4. Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `test_peace_sign.py`
- All 5 tests passed successfully:
  - Basic iMessage sending
  - Transcript sending
  - Cooldown functionality
  - Empty transcript handling
  - Long transcript truncation

## How to Use

1. Start the face recognition application:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. The system will:
   - Continuously transcribe speech
   - Detect hand gestures including peace signs
   - Show visual feedback when gestures are detected

3. To send transcript:
   - Speak normally (your speech is continuously transcribed)
   - Show a peace sign ✌️ to the camera
   - The last 15 seconds of transcript will be sent to +15109773150

## Key Features

- **Gesture-based trigger**: No need for voice commands
- **15-second lookback**: Captures recent conversation context
- **Spam prevention**: 5-second cooldown between messages
- **Visual feedback**: Shows "PEACE!" when gesture detected
- **Automatic truncation**: Long messages are truncated to fit iMessage limits

## Files Modified/Created

1. **gesture_detector.py**: Added peace sign detection
2. **imessage_handler.py**: Simplified for gesture-based triggering
3. **main.py**: Integrated peace sign → iMessage workflow
4. **test_peace_sign.py**: New test suite
5. **IMESSAGE_FEATURE.md**: Updated documentation

## Requirements

- macOS (for iMessage integration)
- Messages app signed into iMessage
- Python packages: mediapipe, opencv-python, pyaudio, deepgram
- Microphone for speech transcription
- Camera for gesture detection

## Next Steps

The feature is fully implemented and tested. To customize:
- Change phone number in `imessage_handler.py`
- Adjust lookback duration (currently 15 seconds)
- Modify cooldown period (currently 5 seconds)
- Add additional gesture triggers if needed
